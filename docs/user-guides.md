## Redistrict Colorado
### User Guide
This guide walks through the installation and use of the *RCAnalyzer* application. *RCAnalyzer* computes metrics based on a shapefile and other demographic information.

#### Data
The location and contents of compatible data files
is described [here](https://github.com/chuckcoughlin/redistrict-colorado/tree/master/docs/datasets.md)
in a separate document.
Datasets
of interest should be downloaded and stored locally. The application re-reads the files each time it accesses them for the first time.
