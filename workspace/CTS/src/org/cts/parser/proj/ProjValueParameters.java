/*
 * Coordinate Transformations Suite (abridged CTS)  is a library developped to

 * Its main focus are simplicity, flexibility, interoperability, in this order.

 * This library has been originally developed by MichaÃ«l Michaud under the JGeod
 * name. It has been renamed CTS in 2009 and shared to the community from
