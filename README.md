## Redistrict Colorado
This repository contains source-code for "RCAnalyzer", a tool that displays and analyzes voter maps. It is designed specifically to address the redistricting requirements for Colorado after the 2020 census.

The main application is based on the OpenJUMP open-source project greatly simplified to focus only on the file types relevant to redistricting and modernized to run on current versions of Java and JavaFX graphics.

The application is a Java desktop application. Its function is to analyze district boundary "Shapefile" maps by combining them with population and votor statistics. The goal is to be able to compare competing map designs for fairness.

 Note that the actual datasets are publicly available and should be downloaded separately.
