## Redistrict Colorado
"FairnessAnalyzer" compares redistricting plans for fairness. It is specifically designed to analyze competing plans for redistricting Colorado after the 2020 census.

The tool is a desktop application that takes "Shapefile" maps of district boundaries and combines them with population and voter affiliation statistics to generate an array of metrics. The ultimate goal is a comparison competing plans for fairness.

For details on operation of the application and a thorough description of the algorithms used, see the [User Guide](http://github.com/chuckcoughlin/redistrict-colorado/tree/master/docs/user-guide.md). For development details including attribution for open source components, see the [Toolchain Manual](http://github.com/chuckcoughlin/redistrict-colorado/tree/master/docs/toolchain.md). [Release Notes](http://github.com/chuckcoughlin/redistrict-colorado/tree/master/docs/release-notes.md) contain a history of feature development.

 Note that the datasets which define plan boundaries, demographics and voter affiliations are not part of the application. They must be downloaded separately. The [Datasets](https://github.com/chuckcoughlin/redistrict-colorado/tree/master/docs/datasets.md) document lists publicly-available sources that have been successfully utilized in the application.
