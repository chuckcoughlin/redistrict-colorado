## Redistrict Colorado
"FairnessAnalyzer" is a tool that compares redistricting plans for fairness. It is specifically designed to analyze competing plans for redistricting Colorado after the 2020 census.

The application is a desktop application that takes "Shapefile" maps of district boundaries and combines them with population and voter affiliation statistics to generate a n array of metrics. The ultimate goal is to be able to compare competing plans for fairness.

For details on how to operate the application plus a thorough description of the algorithms used, see the [UserGuide](http://github.com/chuckcoughlin/redistrict-colorado/tree/master/docs/user-guides.md). For development details including attribution for the open open source projects used, see the [Toolchain](http://github.com/chuckcoughlin/redistrict-colorado/tree/master/docs/toolchain.md) manual.

 Note that the datasets which define plan boundaries, demographics and voter affiliations are not part of the application. They must be downloaded separately. The [Datasets](https://github.com/chuckcoughlin/redistrict-colorado/tree/master/docs/datasets.md) manual lists a collection of publicly-available sources.
